# My Hangman Game

This is a web app that I made using react, it lets you play the traditional game of 'hangman', where a random word is chosen and you have to guess letters.

## Project Description

I made this hangman game as part of my HyperionDev bootcamp. It allows a player to play a digital version of the game 'hangman'.

## How to Play

The aim of the game is to guess the randomly generated word before the final image is displayed.

 1. To start, click: 'New Game'.
 2. A random word will be chosen for you, and you have to guess it correctly!
 3. You have 10 guesses. To make a guess, click a letter on the on-screen keyboard
 4. If that letter is in the word, you'll be shown its position in the word.
 5. If that letter isn't in the word, then it'll go red and you'll lose a life
 6. If you don't correctly guess the word before the hangman image completes, you lose!
 7. If you correctly guess the word, you win!

## Installation

Download the zip file containing all my code from github

Make a new folder where you want to put the files, then unzip the zip file and make it go in there.

Open the command terminal and navigate to the folder than contains the package.json file

You'll need to use npm install, because I have deleted the node modules. These are needed for it to run.

Then run npm start from the command terminal, this will boot up the app in a new browser window
